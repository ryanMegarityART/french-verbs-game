# french-verbs-game

## game rules
The game will display a French word, the player needs to find the English translation of this word.

They will be provided with two additional pieces of information:
1. The first letter of the translated word
2. The number of letters in the translated word

The player starts with 10 points

When the player makes a mistake they lose a point, when they find the word they gain a point

If a player reaches 0 points they lose 

If a player reaches 20 points they win
